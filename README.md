KaggleX Cohort 3 Project: Generating Videos using User Prompts
This project was part of a KaggleX-BIPOC Program. The project was focused on empowering creatives through generative AI to streamline content. Specifically, Text-to-Video content.

The user can open the 'mygenapp_version_3.ipynb' file or use the main app.py and include the necessary libraries to run the app. 15GB of GPU is necessary to run the model.
In the app, the user can type in a prompt to generate a 5 second video using 15GB of GPU.

For example, when the prompt is 'Darth Vader surfing' is entered, we get the following.
